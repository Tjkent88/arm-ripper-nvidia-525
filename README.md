# arm-ripper-nvidia-525

Added the update for pioneer drive bug issue noted 
https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/issues/779
This directly effects my set up so I am patching it here. Once this has been patched in the code, I will remove it in favor of the new route.

Based on the container by

This is a fork for encoding with nvidia devices.
